# Test excersice #1 for Routee

This is a test excersice for a front-end assessment in Routee

## Original requirements

Create an email HTML based on the mockup: https://xd.adobe.com/view/0acbb10d-d9dc-492b-7455-72764d263cee-7cfa/ 

The assets required for the HTML are included on the link as well as basic style settings in CSS. ( </> button).
The HTML must be properly written in code and not with any short of builder.
The HTML must comply with structure restrictions of emails in order to be delivered properly to the email clients.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` file in your browser

## Known issues

I use relative URLs for images, all images are placed in the `assets` folder. They will be unavailable if you will use `index.html`
as email. To fix it, these assets should be delivered from public server or CDN and URLs should be replaced with full paths to those images.
